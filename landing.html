                  Patent law is an area of law that assists an inventor’s
                  exclusive right to use their own invention. Patent law aims to
                  encourage new products and inventions by granting creators the
                  legal right to use and profit from the things that they
                  create. As patent attorneys, we help clients apply for patents
                  and license patents.

                      Design Patents are easy to apply for, and inexpensive. We charge $900 + filing fees (typically $280 if you qualify as a “micro entity”) + fees for the drawings if you can’t do them yourself (typically $350-400) for filing. For that price, we handle the preparation and filing of the design patent, as well as any “informal” rejections that the patent office might make.

                     <div id="model">A design patent is infringed if an ordinary observer would think that the accused design is substantially the same as the patented design when the two designs are compared in the context of the prior art. Apple was awarded $290 million in damages on their design patent.</div>
                     <br>
                     <div id="model">Design patents are easier to get than “utility” patents. All patents, including design patents, are examined by the patent office before the patent is granted. For a design patent, however, the patent office rarely makes any kind of rejection of the design patent, because most designs are unique. So in many ways it is easier to get a design patent, than it is to get a utility patent. Most design patents get allowed by the patent office right away. </div>
