                                    I charge a flat fee of $325 to do a trademark “knockout” search and filing in
                                    the patent office for a one class trademark. There is also a trademark filing
                                    fee of $350 for the one class. There are extra fees if you want the trademark to
                                    cover multiple different kinds of things, since each thing you want to cover may
                                    be classified in a separate class. See the FAQ below about trademark classes.

                                    If the trademark office agrees that the trademark should be accepted, and you
                                    have filed based on actual use of the trademark, then there will be no
                                    additional costs. If the trademark office finds something wrong with the
                                    trademark, there will be additional costs for me to file a response to address
                                    this. Also, if you filed the trademark based on your intent to use it, there
                                    will be a $500 fee at the time you actually use the trademark .

                                    The trademark office usually examines trademarks within 3 to 5 months from
                                    filing. If there are any objections at that point, the trademark office might
                                    send us a rejection. If there are no rejections at that point the trademark will
                                    be published for opposition. If all goes well, we get the trademark around 4
                                    months after that. Most of the time it takes 7 to 12 months to get a trademark
                                    from its initial filing.

                                    There are many different trademark classes, each representing a different
                                    product or service which the trademark office classifies differently. For
                                    example, clothes are in one class, Internet services are in another class. You
                                    have to pay the trademark office separately for each class you want to file in.
                                    For example if you’re a gym, you might file under gymnasiums as one class, and
                                    you might also want to use your logo on a T-shirt which would be another class.
                                    Each trademark class is considered a separate trademark application, and they
                                    can be examined and rejected separately.
                                </p>

                                    What kinds of rejections does the trademark office raise against trademarks?
                                </h5>
                                <p id="modal-p">


                                    The two most common rejections are based on likelihood of confusion with another
                                    trademark, or that the trademark is merely descriptive of the product or service
                                    that you’re using it with.
                                    <br> <br>

                                    A trademark will be rejected if it’s sufficiently close to another trademark in
                                    us the same or a similar class. The trademark office will say that your
                                    trademark raises a likelihood of confusion with the other trademark. We can file
                                    an office action response to attempt to explain why to trademarks are not
                                    confusingly similar.
                                    <br> <br>

                                    A trademark will also be rejected if the patent office thinks that the mark
                                    merely describes an ingredient or quality of the goods or services that it’s
                                    being used to describe. Usually we can either argue these, or file a trademark
                                    in a special way that avoids this kind of rejection.
