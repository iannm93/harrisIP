                                    What is a provisional patent application (PPA) and why would I want to file one?
                                </h5>
                                <p id="modal-p">

                                    A provisional patent application is a temporary patent application that you can file
                                    that establishes your filing date. The provisional application lasts for only one
                                    year. At the end of that one year, the provisional patent lapses, and you need to
                                    file a non-provisional utility patent application if you want to continue with
                                    protecting your invention. However, during that one year pendency of the provisional
                                    application, your filing date has been established in the patent office by the
                                    filing of the provisional patent application. During that year, you can claim patent
                                    pending status, and nobody else can file any patent and get an earlier filing date
                                    than your invention. A main advantage of a provisional patent application is that
                                    they can be prepared and filed much faster and cheaper than a full utility
                                    application. The disadvantage of the Provisional patent application is that it is
                                    never examined by the patent office, and can never turn into a patent. So the
                                    provisional patent application allows you to protect your invention temporarily at a
                                    lower cost with a provisional patent application, but eventually you’ll need to file
                                    utility patent application if you want to continue that protection.

                                    Jane invents widget x, on January 1, 2020. Mike invents widget x a month later on
                                    February 1, 2020. Mike immediately files a provisional application on February 2,
                                    2020. Jane, however, takes her time, and files a full utility patent application,
                                    but not until March 1, 2020. Mike eventually files the full utlity patent
                                    application, on February 1, 2021.

                                    Mike, Mike still has an earlier filing date than Jane and so Mike gets the patent.

                                    If you have the money, and are sure you will be filing for a patent, then a full
                                    utility patent application is usually the way to go. Utility patent applications get
                                    examined by the patent office, and eventually become enforceable US patents. Once
                                    you have the patent, you can use that to stop any other person in the United States
                                    from making, using or selling the invention that is claimed in your patent
                                    application.

                                    That’s a tough question, and really depends on your circumstances. If you have the
                                    money, and you know for sure you want the patent, then you should file a full
                                    utility patent application. It’s more money, but it starts the patent examination
                                    process. On the other hand, if you’re not sure about your invention, or you’re on a
                                    budget, a provisional patent may be the best for you.

                                    Most utility patent applications cost around $3500-$5000 to prepare (depending on

                                    take a lot longer. Most utility patent applications wait at least a year before
                                    their examined, and some substantially longer. After the examination, the patent
                                    office will respond and usually ask you what you think is patentable about your
                                    invention. After all of this back and forth with the patent office, most patents
                                    take between one and 2 years to obtain them.

                                    Sometimes, more than one response is needed. Even once the patent office agrees to
                                    allow the patent, there is still an issue fee. And after the patent is issued, there
                                    are maintenance fees.

                                    No, a patent only covers you in the United States. You can file other patents to
                                    cover you elsewhere in the world, at an additional cost.

                                    I've heard that my competitor can make "one little change" to get around my patent.

                                    This is a myth. A well written patent, like the ones we write, will cover many
                                    different modifications and ways of using your invention. A well written patent will
                                    prevent someone from getting around your patent by making an insignificant change.

                                    The US patent system now operates on a first to file system: that is the first
                                    person to file the patent application is awarded the patent, even if someone else
                                    had invented the idea first. This is one of the strong reasons to file a provisional
                                    application as fast as you can (see FAQ above): because if you’re the first one to
                                    file, then you win. Under the old patent system, the patent was awarded to the first
                                    person to invent, even if that was not the first person to file. Under that old
                                    system, people did lots of things to try and establish that they were really the
                                    first inventor of the invention even if they weren’t the first to file. This is the
                                    basis of the poor man’s patent. People would write themselves letters explaining the
                                    invention, and never open the letter, reasoning that this would prove that they were
                                    really the first inventor. All of these different ways of establishing that you are
                                    the first inventor were called, collectively, a poor man’s patent. Under the modern
                                    first to file system, the poor man’s patent gives you no rights at all, and thus the
                                    poor man’s patents are now nothing but an urban folktale.
